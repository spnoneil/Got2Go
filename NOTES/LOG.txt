8:00 - 9:00ish : Set up environment, install create-react-native and android studio, general react native research
9:00 - 10:00ish: Continue the installation / configuration saga; create virtual test devices
10:21: THE STRUGGLE IS REAL; serious difficulty in creating AVD via android studio, complete with strange installation errors.
11:03: still haven't figured out virtual device issues, however currently opening proj on own galaxy s20; success!(?)
Think I will focus primarily on developing for my phone/android... Now that the environment is (relatively) set up, gonna run one more "test" then spend some time on component diagrams.
10:52: live updates via mobile seemingly configured (yay port forwarding, I'm sure this is not the most secure setup for the future) 
12:00: LUNCH
1:00: Time is an illusion; lunchtime, doubly so
2:00: finish brainstorm/diagram... will add to if needed, but hopefully enough to meet MVP at present
2:20: research on MongoDB, comparing to Firebase
~commits~
3:30: looks like Expo is incompatible with MongoDB Realm? Probably going Firebase
4:40: mostly commits, heavy planning/research day... hard coding comes next

SEE GIT LOG
11:00 - 12:00: more environment variable nonsense, updated java to attempt JAVA_HOME env variable to read, added variable manually, clean out harddrive a bit; maybe having HDD issues?
1:00 - 2:30: followed along on a reactnative tutorial, hooking google maps into project
