CAPSTONE IDEAS:

Names:
Doody Duty
Got2Go
GottaGo

Public bathroom yelp:
We don't like to talk about it, but everybody does it. Wouldn't it be great if you knew it was clean and safe?
"when ya gotta, we gotcha"

criteria:
- cleanliness
- safety
- free / not free
- public / private
- 

MOBILE ONLY?

api:
- google maps
- 
- (expo? react native?)

languages/tools:
- JS/Node
- REACT Native 
- Expo SDK
- Firebase/Firestore


chrome extension???
library???


To run your project, navigate to the directory and run one of the following npm commands.

- cd capstone
- npm run android
- npm run ios # you need to use macOS to build the iOS project - use the Expo app if you need to do iOS development without a Mac
- npm run web


INITIAL EMAILED CAPSTONE PROPOSAL:
"Name of Student:
Scott O'Neil

Name of Project:
"CurrentlyUntitled," but I should be able to brainstorm something ridiculous

Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)
Allows users to login to an account, and via a map api (likely google) will allow them to "pin" locations of bathrooms, with info on public/private, cleanliness, safety, LGBTQ-friendliness, etc. Considering this will by nature need to be on-the-go, I will likely need to learn React Native and design this mobile-first.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
As a user, I want to log in and see my own and others reviews.
As a user, I want to drop pins into a map to report the location of restrooms.
..., I want to be able to review my locations on predetermined criteria, such as cleanliness.
..., I want to be able to find locations nearby or in any given area.

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
1. REACT Native / JavaScript
2. HTML / CSS
3. Firebase / Firestore
4. Google Maps API (or similar)

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
- Ultra slick styling
- Increased CRUD functionality, able to delete own posts, etc.

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
- Bootstrap or Tailwind for styling

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
Not at present... More than happy to talk about everything, in fact I would love to know your thoughts!"
